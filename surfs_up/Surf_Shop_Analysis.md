# Surf and Ice Cream Shop Analysis

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy with more information about temperature trends before opening the Surf and Ice Cream Shop in Oahu. W. Avy had a failed Surf Shop venture in the past, so they are being cautious with this new venture. W. Avy would like to see temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the Surf and Ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.

## Results
Below, please find the three key differences in weather between June and December:

- There is a minimal difference in the mean (average) temperature of a almost 4 degrees (3.9), when comparing June and December.

- The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees, compared to December at 56 degrees, which is a difference of 8 degrees. 

- The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees, compared to December 83 degrees, which is a difference of 2 degrees

## Summary
There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
1) How many days in December it fell below 64 degrees (the lowest temperature in June)
2) Pull data from other hawaiian islands to see if there is another island that has more favoroable weather.
