# Surf and Ice Cream Shop Analysis

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy with more information about temperature trends before opening the Surf and Ice Cream Shop in Oahu. W. Avy had a failed Surf Shop venture in the past, so they are being cautious with this new venture. W. Avy would like to see temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the Surf and Ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.

## Results
Below, please find the three key differences in weather between June and December:

- There is a minimal difference in the mean (average) temperature of appproximately 4 degrees (3.9), when comparing June 74 degrees and December 71 degrees.

- The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees, compared to December at 56 degrees, which is a difference of 8 degrees. 

- The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees, compared to December at 83 degrees, which is a difference of 2 degrees

## Summary
Overall, this analysis indicates that there are minimal differences between the weather in June and December in Oahu as the greatest difference in temperature is only 8 degrees. Based on the findings, the reward appears to be greater than the risk for this venture. 

If W. Avy would like further analysis conducted, the recommendation would be to perform two additional queries on the June and December data:

1) Deterrmrine how many days in December fell below 64 degrees, which is the lowest temperature in June), as falling below this temperature will likley have a negative impact on surfing and ice cream sales.
2) Determine how many days in June hit between 80 - 85 degrees as this would likely increase surfing and ice cream sales, and help bridge the slightly lower sales in December.
